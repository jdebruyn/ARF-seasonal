TEMPERATURE, MOISTURE, ELECTRICAL CONDUCTIVITY SENSOR DATA
The following files are required:
decagon_SP.csv
decagon_WIN.csv

This pair of files is used to generate all temperature, moisture, and conductivity (sensor-based) figures and table data. 
Temperature data falling below the 0C threshold was corrected to 0C. 
In instances where sensors failed, notably during study day 282 for internal temperature values, ambient mean temperatures were substituted for internal means. 
In instances where sensors skipped an hourly reading (notably during time or battery changes), adjacent values were substituted for the missing data.
